          <h2>History and Legacy</h2>
          Arsenal FC, founded in 1886 as Dial Square, quickly evolved into one of England's most iconic football clubs. Known for their innovation both on and off the field, Arsenal became the first club from the South of England to join the Football League in 1893.
    </p>
    <p>
      The club achieved its first major success during the 1930s under the legendary manager Herbert Chapman, who introduced groundbreaking tactical innovations like the WM formation and floodlit matches. Arsenal dominated the English football scene with five First Division titles and two FA Cups during that decade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most iconic moment in Arsenal's modern history came during the 2003-2004 season, when the team, managed by Ars√®ne Wenger, completed an entire Premier League campaign unbeaten. Nicknamed "The Invincibles," this squad became the gold standard of consistency and excellence in football.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arsenal also holds the record for the most FA Cup wins, with 14 trophies to their name. The club has continued to build on its proud traditions, fostering a commitment to developing young talent, playing attacking football, and promoting a strong community ethos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Based at the state-of-the-art Emirates Stadium since 2006, Arsenal remains a global powerhouse, with a rich legacy and a dedicated fanbase that spans the globe.
